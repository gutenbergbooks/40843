<h3>
<span>READINGS IN SHAKSPEARE, NO. III.</span>
</h3>


<p class="center"><i>Hamlet</i>, Act I. Sc. 5.</p>

<div class="poem">

      <p>"My tables, my tables,&mdash;meet it is I set it down."</p>

</div>

<p>This line (which might have suggested to our worthy patron, Captain
Cuttle, the posy on our title-page) has, in my opinion, been misapplied
and misinterpreted; and, as I am unable to convince myself that the view
I take of it, albeit in opposition to all other readers of Shakspeare,
is wrong, I venture to remove my light from under the bushel, although
in so doing am sorely in dread of its being rudely puffed upon.</p>

<p>The more so, because the natural hesitation which must be felt, in any
case, when challenging for the first time the correctness of a generally
received reading, is, in this instance, greatly augmented, by finding
that an illustrious commenter upon Shakspeare&mdash;himself a great and
congenial poet&mdash;has conferred a special approbation upon the old
reading, by choosing it out as an item in his appreciation of Hamlet's
character.</p>

<p>I allude to Coleridge, whose remark is this:</p>

  <p class="blockquot">"Shakspeare alone could have produced the vow of Hamlet, to make
   his memory a blank of all maxims and generalised truths that
   'observation had copied there,' followed immediately by the
   speaker noting down the generalised fact&mdash;</p>

  <p class="blockquot">"'That one may smile, and smile, and be a villain.'</p>


  <p class="blockquot">  "Now, that this last line <i>is</i> really what Shakspeare <i>intended to be
    noted down</i>, is precisely the point that goes so much "against the
    stomach of my sense!"</p>

<p>This jotting down by Hamlet, upon a real substantial table, of one of
those "generalised truths" which he had just excluded from the table of
his memory, would be such a <i>literalising of the metaphor</i>, that it is a
great relief to me to feel convinced that Shakspeare never intended it.</p>

<p>In Hamlet's discourse there may be observed an under current of thought
that is continually breaking forth in <i>apostrophe</i>. In the present
instance it is directed to his uncle:</p>

<div class="poem">

     <p> "O villain, villain, smiling, damned villain!</p>
     <p> That one may smile, and smile, and be a villain!</p>
     <p> At least I'm sure it may be so in Denmark&mdash;</p>
     <p> So! uncle, <i>there</i> you are!"<a id="Page_242"></a> <span class="pagenum">[242]</span></p>

</div>

<p class="noindent">Is not all this <i>one continued apostrophe</i>? The second line an
admirative comment upon the first, and the fourth line, even in the
present day, a common exclamation expressive of misdeeds, or intentions,
unexpectedly brought to light? But it is not this most trite reflection,
in the second line, that Hamlet wishes to set down. No, it is the
all-absorbing <i>commandment</i>:</p>

<div class="poem">

    <p>  "And thy commandment all alone shall live</p>
    <p>  Within the book and volume of my brain,</p>
     <p> Unmixed with baser matter&mdash;</p>
<p>&mdash;&nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;&mdash;</p>
<p>  "My tables, my tables,&mdash;meet it is I set it down!"</p>

</div>

<p class="noindent"><i>Set it down</i>, in order that the exact words of the
commandment&mdash;subsequently quoted to the very letter&mdash;may be preserved.</p>

<p>To suppose that Hamlet gets forth his tables for the purpose of setting
down a common-place truism, <i>because</i> he has reserved no place for such
matters <i>in the table of his memory</i>, is surely to materialise a fine
poetical image by contrasting it with a substantial matter of fact
operation.</p>

<p>And to suppose, with Coleridge, that the very absurdness of the act is a
subtle indication of incipient madness, is an over refinement in
criticism, as intenable as it is unnecessary.</p>

<p>Hamlet evinces no semblance of unsettled mind, real or assumed, until
joined by Horatio and Marcellus; and, even then, his apparently
misplaced jocularity does not commence until he has finally determined
<i>to withhold</i> the secret he had twice been on the point of disclosing:</p>

<div class="poem">
     <p> "How say you then, would the heart of man once think it?&mdash;
      But you'll be secret."</p>
</div>

<p class="noindent">Again:</p>

<div class="poem">
     <p> "There's ne'er a villain dwelling in all Denmark&mdash;
      But he's an arrant knave."</p>
</div>

<p>I do not know whether I am singular in the view I take of these two
sentences, but I understand them as <i>inchoate disclosures</i>, suddenly
broken off through the irresolution of the speaker.</p>

<p>For instance, I do not understand the last, as Horatio understood
it&mdash;"<i>There needs no ghost from the grave to tell us this</i>;" but I
understand it as an intended revelation, begun, withdrawn, and cleverly
turned off by the substitution of a ridiculous termination. It is
<i>then</i>, when Hamlet finally resolves to withhold the secret, at least
from Marcellus (when or where Horatio afterwards acquires it, is not
explained), that he seeks to conceal his overwrought feelings by assumed
levity.</p>

<p>Such is the way I read this scene; and, while I freely admit the
difficulty presented in the fact, that, amongst so many acute students
of Shakspeare, no one before should have seen any difficulty in the
usual interpretation of this passage, I must at the same time declare,
that I can perceive no single point in favour of that interpretation,
save and except the placing of the "stage direction" where it now is.
But this may have arisen from the early printers being misled by the
apparent sequence of the word "that," with which the next line
commences:</p>

<div class="poem">
              <p>&mdash;&mdash;"meet it is I set it down</p>
     <p> <i>That</i>" &amp;c.</p>
</div>

<p>It may be observed, however, that such a commencement, to a sentence
expressive of wonder or incredulity, was by no needs uncommon. As, for
example, in the first scene of <i>Cymbeline</i>:</p>

<div class="poem">
     <p> "That a <i>king's</i> children should be so convey'd!"</p>

</div>

<p>I really can perceive little <i>else</i> than this "stage direction" to
favour the usual reading, while, in that proposed by me, the sequence of
action appears to be the most natural in the world:&mdash;</p>

<p>First, "My tables, my tables," &amp;c.</p>

<p>Next, the continuation of the interrupted apostrophe, which occupies the
time while getting forth and preparing the tables.</p>

<p>Next, the abrupt exclamation, "Now to my word."</p>

<p>And finally, the dictating, <i>to the pen</i>, the express words of the last
line of the ghost's speech.</p>

<p>In point of fact, the best possible <i>stage direction</i> is given by
Shakspeare himself, when he makes Hamlet exclaim, "<i>Now to my word</i>,"
or, now to my <i>memorandum</i>, reverting to the purpose for which he had
got his tables forth. In the old reading, Steevens was driven to explain
"now to my word" in this way, "Hamlet alludes to the <i>watchword</i> given
every day in military service."</p>

<p>It is of the more importance that this point, raised by me, should be
fairly and impartially examined, because, being in correction of alleged
misinterpretation, its decision must have some influence upon a right
discrimination of the character of Hamlet's madness, as opposed to the
deduction drawn by Coleridge. In taking it into consideration, the
following alterations in the existing punctuation must be premised:&mdash;</p>

<p>After "set it down," a full stop; after "and be a villain," a note of
admiration; the stage direction "(<i>writing</i>)" to be removed two lines
lower down.</p>

<h4>
<span><i>Burning Fern brings Rain.</i></span>
</h4>

<p>&mdash;In a volume containing miscellaneous
collections by Dr. Richard Pococke, in the British Museum, MS. Add.
15,801, at fol. 33. is the copy of a letter written by Philip Herbert,
third Earl of Pembroke, Lord Chamberlain, to the Sheriff of
Staffordshire, which illustrates a curious popular belief of the period,
from which even the king was not free. It is as follows:<a id="Page_243"></a> <span class="pagenum">[243]</span></p>

 <p class="blockquot"> "S<span class="topnum">r</span>.&mdash;His Majesty taking notice of an opinion entertained in
   Staffordshire, that the burning of Ferne doth draw downe rain,
   and being desirous that the country and himself may enjoy fair
   weather as long as he remains in those parts, His Majesty hath
   commanded me to write unto you, to cause all burning of Ferne to
   bee forborne, untill his Majesty be passed the country. Wherein
   not doubting but the consideration of their own interest, as well
   as of his Ma<span class="topnum">ties</span>, will invite the country to a ready
   observance of this his Ma<span class="topnum">ties</span> command, I rest,</p>

<h3>
<span>TRANSLATIONS.</span>
</h3>

<p>It becomes needful that the translations which are to be copyright
should be accurately made when the new international law comes into
effect. In the <i>Consulship and Empire</i> of M. Thiers, vol. iii. p. 220.,
purporting to be translated by D. Forbes Campbell, "under the sanction
and approval of the author," the following <i>happy</i> piece of translation
occurs:&mdash;</p>

 <p class="blockquot"> "They urged also, that the Maltese people would offer great
   resistance to the destruction of those fine fortresses, and
   proposed the reconstitution of the Order on a new and more solid
   basis. They had no objection to allow the French language still
   to be used there, stipulating only that a college should be
   instituted for teaching the English and Maltese languages. The
   latter for the advantages of the Maltese people, who should have
   a share in its management; they were desirous of placing this new
   settlement under the guarantee of some great power, Russia for
   example. The English were in hopes that with the English and
   Maltese languages spoken by the people who would still be devoted
   to them, they should still have an influence in the island, which
   would prevent the French from again obtaining possession of it."</p>

<p>The translator has invented a college and system of instruction, because
he did not know how to translate "<i>langue</i>!"<a id="ngue1"></a><a title="Go to footnote 1." href="#fn1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> Thus this important
passage is wholly perverted.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a id="fn1"></a><a title="Return to text." href="#ngue1" class="label">[1]</a> "Langue" means Order of Knights of Malta, of the particular
"nation" expressed.</p>

<h3>
<span>BALLAD OF LORD DELAMERE.<br />
(Vol. ii., p. 104.)</span>
</h3>

<p>A correspondent gives the first two lines of a ballad called <i>Lord
Delamere</i>, and inquires to what political event it refers.
 D<span class="smcap lowercase">R</span>. R<span class="smcap lowercase">IMBAULT</span>
(Vol. ii., p. 158.) suggests that this song may be another version of
one published in Mr. Thomas Lyte's <i>Ancient Ballads and Songs</i>, which
begins differently, and which Mr. Lyte fancies may refer to some
corn-law debate in parliament about the years 1621 and 1622. I have a
song which I took down from recitation in Derbyshire, entitled <i>The
Long-armed Duke</i>, but which is no doubt identical with Mr. Lyte's, the
first verse being nearly the same. That it refers to some transaction
much later than 1622 is evident from the mention of Lord Delamere, that
title having been first conferred by Charles II. upon Sir George
Warrington. Henry, second Earl of Delamere, and William, Earl of
Devonshire, are the heroes of the ballad, which I believe to be founded
upon some obscure report of the quarrel which took place between the
latter and Colonel Colepepper, of which an account will be found in the
<i>Works of Lord Delamere</i>, London, 1694, p. 563. (reprinted in Howell's
<i>State Trials</i>, vol. ii. p. 510.), and also in Collins's <i>Peerage</i>, vol.
i. p. 343.; and see also Colley Cibber's <i>Apology</i>, chap. iii.</p>

<p>The Earl of Devonshire struck Colonel Colepepper in the anteroom at
Whitehall, having previously received an affront from the Colonel in the
king's palace. He was summoned to appear at the King's Bench, and gave
bail to the amount of 30,000<i>l.</i>; Lord Delamere being one of his
sureties. A fine to that amount was inflicted on him, but he appealed
from the judgment to the House of Lords, where one of his warmest
advocates was Lord Delamere. Vague reports of these proceedings would
find their way into the North, where the matter would be handled by the
balladmongers in a style congenial to the manners and ideas of their
rustic auditory. Lord Delamere is described by a cotemporary versifier
as</p>

<div class="poem">

     <p> "Fit to assist to pull a tyrant down,</p>
     <p> But not to please a prince that mounts the throne."</p>

<p class="noindent">These lines are given, without a reference, in a note to Burton's

<p>My version of the ballad was printed about nine years ago in a
periodical called <i>The Storyteller</i>, which came to an abrupt conclusion
in the<a id="Page_244"></a> <span class="pagenum">[244]</span> second volume, and is probably now in the hands of few.

<h4>
<span><i>A Note on Henry III.</i></span>
</h4>

<p>&mdash;In Vol. v., p. 28., is the Query, "Are our Lists
of English Sovereigns completed?" Some further illustration of the case
of the king usually styled Henry III., to which particular attention was
directed, may be derived from the subjoined extract taken from a MS.
(No. 146.) in the University Library at Cambridge. The MS. is a
parchment roll containing a "genealogical tree" of the kings of England,
with brief notices written in the fifteenth century. On one side of the
medallion on which is inscribed "Henricus tercius," is a brief eulogy of
the king; on the other side is the following:</p>

   <p class="blockquot">"Iste Henricus dictus est tercius quia sic intitulatur in
   Cronicis hystoriis scriptis et cartis non ratione numerali sed
   regie denominationes (<i>sic</i>) vel dignitatis verbi gracia si

<p>&mdash;Your correspondent J. H.

lately saw advertised in a catalogue the following title of a work,
<i>Fulfilment of Scripture Prophecies on Nations and Kingdoms, by John

he already had, viz., <i>Epitome of the History of the World, by John

<h4>
<span><i>Bowdler's Family Shakspeare.</i></span>
</h4>

<p>&mdash;It has occurred to me that a cheap
edition of Bowdler's <i>Family Shakspeare</i> would be in much request, and
might conveniently be published in numbers consisting of single plays at
3<i>d.</i> each. This would bring the whole to about 9<i>s.</i>, bound in three
handy volumes. A new edition might contain the more recent typographical
corrections and the names printed at length, a very desirable amendment.
Will Messrs. Longman, the publishers of Bowdler's <i>Shakspeare</i>, look
favourably on this suggestion when they see it in "N. &amp; Q."? It would be
an invaluable addition to their <i>Traveller's Library</i>.</p>

<h4>
<span><i>The French Language.</i></span>
</h4>

<p>&mdash;It has continually appeared to me as a great
absurdity, that the terms masculine and feminine should be applied to
inanimate things in the French language, when common sense is opposed to
such a distinction. I think the reason for using feminine and masculine
articles in conjunction with nouns said to be of those genders, is to be
found in the rule which obtains in the Irish or Celtic language, namely,
that of "caol re caol," <i>i.e.</i> fine with fine, and "leatair re leatair,"
<i>i.e.</i> broad with broad vowels or sounds. I throw out this hint to those
who are better qualified to investigate the matter; as I feel sure it
would be a great benefit to learners of the French language to have a
clear rule to guide them, instead of the present system, which is very
complicated.</p>

<h4>
<span><i>Curious Epitaph.</i></span>
</h4>

<p>&mdash;The following portion of an epitaph from the tomb of
Thomas Carter, 1706, in the church of St. Gregory, Sudbury, will
doubtless interest some of your readers; it is as well to premise that
he was a very charitable man, as the whole inscription (which would
occupy about forty lines) fully records:</p>

<div class="center">

                   <p class="noindent"> "Viator mirum referam</p>
 <p class="noindent"> Quo die efflavit animam Thos. Carter, prædictus,</p>
  <p class="noindent">Acûs foramen transivit Camelus Sudburiensis.</p>
   <p class="noindent"> Vade, et si dives sis, tu fac similiter.</p>
                        <p class="noindent"> Vale."</p>

</div>

<p>Permit me to translate it for the benefit of your lady readers:</p>

<div class="poem">

<p>  "Traveller, I will relate a prodigy. </p>
<p>On the day whereon the aforesaid Thomas Carter breathed out his soul, </p>
<p>a Sudbury camel passed through the eye of a needle.</p>
<p> Go, and if thou art wealthy,    do thou likewise. </p>
<p>Farewell."</p>

<span class="bla">Queries.</span>
</h2>

<h3>
<span>"HOGS NORTON, WHERE PIGS PLAY UPON THE ORGANS."</span>
</h3>

<p>I should be much obliged by any of your correspondents favouring me with
their opinions as to the origin of the above saying. Evans, in his
<i>Leicestershire Words</i>, says:</p>

 <p class="blockquot">"The true name of the town, according to Peck, is Hocks Norton,
   but vulgarly pronounced Hogs Norton. The organist to this parish
   church was named Piggs."</p>

<p>But in Witt's <i>Recreations</i>, of which I have a copy of 1640, the
eighty-third epigram is "upon pigs devouring a bed of penny-royal,
commonly called <i>organs</i>:"</p>


<div class="poem">
    <p>  "A good wife once, a bed of organs set,</p>
     <p> The pigs came in, and eat up every whit;</p>
    <p>  The goodman said, Wife, you your garden may</p>
     <p> Hogs Norton call, here pigs on organs play."</p>

</div>

<p><i>Organs</i> from "organy;" French, <i>origan</i>; Latin, <i>origanum</i>.</p>

<p>Now it is evident that in 1640 the proverb was in vogue, and well
understood; but organs were not at that time common in churches,
especially parish churches, and as I do not know which of the many
Nortons in England is Mr. Peck's Hocks Norton, I cannot help considering
his derivation somewhat in the light of an anachronism.</p>

<p>I do not know the date of Howell's <i>English Proverbs</i> quoted by Mr.
Halliwell in his <i>Archaic Dictionary</i>. Should there be such a place as
Hog's Norton, or Hock's Norton, is the Hock = Hok = oak tree? Acorns and
pigs were common associates.</p>

<p>The only instance that I recollect of pigs being connected with an
organ, is in that curious freak recorded of the Abbé Debaigne, maître de
musique to Louis XI., when he made a hog-organ by enclosing pigs of
various ages and pitches of voice in a kind of chest; the older ones on
the left hand for the bass, and the younger on the right for the treble:
over all these was suspended a key-board, which, when played on, pressed
long needles into the pigs' backs,&mdash;the result is left to the
imagination.</p>

<h3>
<span class="bla">Minor Queries.</span>
</h3>

<h4>
<span><i>The Judge alluded to by South.</i></span>
</h4>

<p>&mdash;South, in a note in his first Sermon
on Covetousness (vol. iv. p. 448., 4th edition, 1727), tells us of a
lawyer, "a confident of the rebels," who recommended that the Duke of
Gloucester, the youngest son of Charles I., should be bound "to some
good trade, that so he might eat his bread honestly." He then expresses
wonder that Charles II. made this lawyer a judge; a practice, he adds,
and doubtless with a meaning, "not unusual in the courts of some
princes, to encourage and prefer their mortal enemies, before their
truest friends."</p>

<p>Can any of your correspondents tell us more on the subject, and the name
of the judge?</p>

<p>The recommendation was probably given at the time when the Duke and the
Princess Elizabeth were removed from Penshurst to Carisbrooke, where,
according to instructions, they were not to be treated as royal
children.</p>

<p>I may refer your readers to Lord Clarendon's <i>Hist.</i> (vii. 84.), and to
a letter and interesting note in Sir H. Ellis's <i>Collection of Letters</i>,
iii. 329. Evelyn describes the Duke as "a prince of extraordinary
hopes."</p>

<p>Did South, in his reflection on princes, refer to himself? Wood, his
bitter foe, tells us that "he could never be enough loaded with
preferment; while others, who had been reduced to a bit of bread for his
Majesty's cause, could get nothing." In 1660 he "tugged hard," adds
Wood, to be Can of Ch. Ch., but failed: in ten years afterwards he
succeeded.</p>

<span><i>English Translation of the Canons.</i></span>

<p>&mdash;In the 36th canon the record of
the subscriptions is, <i>Quod liber publicæ Liturgiæ ... nihil in se
contineat quod verbo Dei sit contrarium; quodque eodem</i> taliter <i>uti
liceat</i>. This is copied from Bishop Sparrow's collection. The English
translation, to which subscription is now made, has the following
rendering of the second clause&mdash;<i>and that the same may be lawfully
used</i>. The word <i>taliter</i> seems to be not rendered at all. Without
wishing to provoke theological controversy, I should ask, by what
authority, and at what date, was the English translation imposed upon
the clergy and graduates, all of whom understand Latin? Is it affirmed
that the English renders the Latin fully, or is the English translation
avowedly intended to fall short? I will not ask the meaning of the word
<i>taliter</i> in the minds of those who imposed the Latin subscription,
because answers might provoke the inadmissible kind of controversy.</p>

<h4>
<span><i>Meaning of Wallop</i></span>
</h4>

<p>&mdash;In the article of Collins's <i>Peerage</i> which
narrates the history of the "Wallops, Earls of Portsmouth," great and
deserved praise is bestowed upon Sir John Wallop, a most valorous and
successful military commander.</p>

<p>Not to trouble you with more, I make one extract, which is, for more
reasons than one, likely to be interesting:</p>

 <p class="blockquot"> "Sir John Wallop, in 6 Henry VIII., was sent as Admiral and
   Commander-in-Chief of the fleet, to encounter Prior John, the
   French Admiral, who, landing in Sussex, had burnt the town of
   Brighthelmstone. The French getting into their own ports, Sir
   John Wallop sailed to the coast of Normandy, and there landed and
   burnt twenty-one villages and towns with great slaughter, and
   also the ships and boats in the havens of Treaport, Staple, &amp;c.,
   wherein he acquitted himself with such conduct and valour, that
   all our historians have mentioned this expedition much to his
   honour."</p>

<p>The Query which I desire to ask is, whether the significant, but
somewhat coarse phrase of "to wallop," have its origin in the exploits
of this gallant ancestor of the Earl of Portsmouth?</p>

<h4>
<span><i>The "Mistral."</i></span>
</h4>

<p>&mdash;There is an old French proverb which says:</p>
<div class="poem">

     <p> "Trois fléaux en Provence,</p>
     <p> Le Parlement, le Mistral, la Durance."</p>

</div>

<p class="noindent">The first of these scourges has disappeared: the third will probably
last for ever: but what of the second?</p>

<p>The <i>Mistral</i> is a kind of whirlwind (partaking of the character of the
African simoon, or of the West Indian hurricane), which pays its annual
visits to Provence, and causes the most frightful<a id="Page_247"></a> <span class="pagenum">[247]</span> devastation
along the banks of the Rhone. It is spoken of by Seneca, and other
writers of his time; and the Emperor Augustus is said to have raised a
temple to it during his residence in Gaul.</p>

<p>Has any attempt been made, in this age of scientific advancement, to
explain the causes of the <i>Mistral</i>? Perhaps Sir William Reid, from his
present position and opportunities, as Governor of Malta, may be induced
to turn his attention to the subject. An attempt to investigate the
origin of this phenomenon, coupled with an historical sketch of its
progress and effects, would form a valuable chapter in any future
edition of his work on the <i>Law of Storms</i>.</p>

<span><i>Deaths from Fasting.</i></span>
</h4>

<p>&mdash;In the church of St. Mary, Bury St. Edmund's, is
a fine table-tomb, surmounted by a corpse in a winding-sheet, to the
memory of John Bant, whose very curious will has been printed by the
Camden Society. Tradition says that the death of this pious church
decorator arose from the vain attempt to imitate Our Lord in fasting
forty successive days and nights. This tradition has no foundation in
fact, but owes its origin to the figure on the tomb, which would appear
to have been made in the lifetime of the deceased. There are similar
traditions in other parts of the kingdom. Can any of your correspondents
state where, and whether accompanied by similar wasted figures?</p>

<h4>
<span><i>Ad Viscum.</i></span>
</h4>


<p>&mdash;It has not been unusual among antiquaries of a certain
class to cite the following Latin hexameter:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">

     <p> "Ad viscum Druidæ! Druidæ clamare quotannis."</p>

</div>

<p>Two or three times I have seen it accompanied by a general reference to
one Ovidius. But having met with a copy of that author, to which an
index of all his words is annexed, I collect therefrom that the said
Ovidius never expressed himself to that effect.</p>

<p>I should wish to learn whether any body else ever did, and who; or

<h4>
<span><i>Whipping Graves.</i></span>
</h4>

<p>&mdash;Excommunicated persons were formerly restored to the
Church, according to the old <i>Rituale Romanum</i>, by the ceremony of
whipping their graves. When it was resolved the dead party should be
restored to the communion of saints, it was ordered that the body should
not be disentombed, but that the "graves shall be whipped, and while the
priest whips the grave, he shall say&mdash;'By the authority which I have
received I free thee from the bond of excommunication, and restore thee
to the communion of the faithful.'" I do not find this in the copy of
the Ritual I possess. Have any readers of the "N. &amp; Q." a copy with the
directions for this singular service?</p>

<span><i>John Rogers, Protomartyr</i></span>
</h4>


<p>John Rogers, Protomartyr, Prebendary of St. Paul's Cathedral, and
Rector of St. Sepulchre's, was burnt at the stake in Smithfield,
rendering his testimony to the true religion of the Catholic Church of
England: he left a wife and ten children. It is remarkable that no
memorial of this celebrated man is to be found in the church of which he
was the rector. Can any of the readers of "N. &amp; Q." afford information
as to his present descendants? John Rogers, Gentleman, of Charter House
Square, was buried in the nave of the church, Nov. 19. 1775, aged
fifty-four. The degree of consanguinity to the former rector is required
for genealogical purposes.</p>

<span><i>Autograph Music by Handel.</i></span>
</h4>

<p>&mdash;Before me lies a MS. duet in the autograph
of Handel, and also an unfinished "Sonata da Cembalo" by the same
composer. The former piece is thus authenticated by a note written at
the bottom of the last page:</p>

  <p class="blockquot"> "This duett was given to G. Malchair by Philip Hayes, Mus. Dr.,
   with a declaration that it is Mr. Handel's <i>ohne</i> handwriting."</p>

<p>On the wrapper which contains the two pieces is written:</p>

 <p class="blockquot"> "The two inclosed pieces of music <i>ware</i> given to me by my worthy
   friend Dr. Philip Hayes, with an <i>ashurance</i> that they are the
   handwriting of the celebrated Mr. Handel. The duett, indeed, has
   all the appearance of being the original conception of that
   greate man <i>pen'd</i> by himself."</p>

<p>I am desirous of ascertaining from some of your correspondents, better
versed than myself in the soul-stirring music of this noble composer,
whether the duet has been printed; and if so, where it may be found? The
only means of identification which I can supply are these: it is written
in two flats, and the words are&mdash;</p>

1824, supposing that De Pratellis is the same name as Prideaux? Dr.
Oliver says (p. 123.), Adam Prianho or De Pratellis al Prydeaux
appointed prior. Gorham, vol. i. p. 172., says, Robert de Preus (<i>alias</i>
Robert de Pratell?). And again, in vol. ii. p. clxviii., Robert de
Preaux <i>alias</i> Prideaux, was presented by the prior and convent in 1270;
his quotation is from Instituted rolls and Registers, Lincoln Cathedral:
the roll reads Preus and De Pratellis.</p>

   sail-rooms, carpenters' cabins, and other apartments. Also, a

<span><i>Goblin, Gorgeous, Gossip.</i></span>
</h4>

<p>&mdash;May I ask the derivation of the following
English words,&mdash;<i>Goblin</i>, <i>Gorgeous</i>, <i>Gossip</i>?</p>

  <p class="right">    J. G. T.</p>


  <p class="blockquot">[<i>Goblin</i> is derived from the low Latin <i>Gobelinus</i>; see Ducange,
   who defines it, "Dæmon, qui vulgo <i>Faunus</i>, Gallis, <i>Gobelin
   Folastre</i>, German, <i>Kobold</i>," and quotes as his authority
   Ordericus Vitalis.</p>

  <p> <i>Gorgeous</i>, according to Skinner, is from the French <i>Gorgias</i>,
   probably from <i>Gorge</i>, and transferred from the palate to the
   eye. No such word as <i>Gorgias</i> is, however, to be found in
   Roquefort's <i>Glossaire</i>.</p>

  <p> <i>Gossip</i> is from the Anglo-Saxon <i>God-sibbe</i>, "cognatus in Deo."
   Nares in his <i>Glossary</i> furnishes the following apt illustration
   of it: "Our Christian ancestors, understanding a spiritual
   affinity to grow between the parents and such as undertooke for
   the child at baptism, called each other by the name of <i>God-sib</i>,
   that is, of kin together through God; and the child, in like

capella quar pietes sunt de maheremio et plaustro et maheremi&#363; inde

<p>Will any of your readers kindly inform an unskilled person the meaning
of this description?</p>

as "ccc volucr<span class="topnum">s</span> quæ voc<span class="topnum">r</span>

laburnum wood, from the town of Truro.</p>

       <p class="right">   S. R. P.</p>

 <p class="left">     Launceston.</p>


 <p class="blockquot"> [The meaning of the first passage quoted by our correspondent is
   clearly, "una parva capella quarum parietes sunt de <i>maheremio</i>
   et plastro, et maheremium inde fere disjungitur," <i>i.e.</i> "one
   small chapel whose walls are of timber and plaster (or, as we
   say, built of lath and plaster), and the timbers thereof for the
   most part disjointed." Under the word <i>Materia</i>, Ducange gives
   Mæremium, Maheremium, and many other forms of the word, which is
   used for timber.</p>

 <p class="blockquot"><i>Un arc de Arbouin.</i>&mdash;If our correspondent will refer to Ducange
   sub <i>Arcus</i>, he will find him, sub "Arcus de Aubour," citing
   <i>Monast. Ang.</i>, tom. ii. p. 602., and explaining it, "arcus
   bellici species. Regestum Philippi Augusti, fol. 159. Habet

  <p> A learned friend whom we have consulted reminds us that besides
   the common Laburnum, which it is obvious could not be the wood
   referred to, there is another sort known to our gardeners as
   "Cytisus Alpinus," Scotch Laburnum, which grows into an actual
   tree, and supplies the hard black wood used by the French as
   ebony, and called by them False Ebony. It is of notorious
   hardness, and would have done well for bows. It is a native of
   Dauphiné, and indigenous also in the Alps, and, even if unknown
   in England in the reign of Edward III., was probably used in the
   Alpine countries for bows, and possibly imported into England for
   the same purpose.]</p>

<h3>
<span>MORAVIAN HYMNS.<br />
(Vol. v., pp. 30. 113.)</span>
</h3>

<p>As no reply has been given to your various correspondents on the above
subject by one of the Brethren's church, permit a friend to give a few
particulars with which he has become acquainted.</p>

<p>The first <i>authorised</i> English edition of the Moravian hymn-book is that
of 1754, in the preface to which it is stated, that though there had
been some English Collections of Hymns, partly original, and partly
translations from the German, in use among the societies in union with
the Brethren's church, "these were never regularly authorised, nor
always passably reviewed." This book is a bulky 8vo.: it is in two
parts; the first consisting of 380 pages, and the second of upwards of
400; together containing about 1200 hymns and Scripture anthems. The
next edition appeared in 1769; and a third twenty years later. There
have been several editions during the present century, in 8vo., 12mo.,
and 18mo., the last of which was published in 1819; and the preface
states that the whole of the hymns had been revised by "Brother James
Montgomery" of Sheffield.</p>

<p>To the inquiry of C. B. as to the honesty of <i>Rimius</i>, I would refer him
to an excellent essay by the Rev. P. Latrobe, appended to Jackson's
translation of the <i>Life of Count Zinzendorf</i>, by Spangenberg. (London,
1838.)</p>

<p>The memory of your Thurles correspondent is at fault, as may be
supposed, from a twenty-five years' recollection. Bishop Gambold could
not have published a Moravian hymn-book in 1738, for he did not join the
Brethren's church till November, 1742; nor was he consecrated a bishop
till 1754.&mdash;See his Life, appended to his <i>Works</i>, printed by S. Hazard,
of Bath, 1789.</p>

<p>When Southey's animadversions appeared, they were replied to by "William
Okely, M.D., Presbyter of the Brethren's Church, and Minister of their
Congregation at Bristol," in a letter written in a good-humoured style,
yet caustic withal. Unfortunately, as long as Southey's work lasts the
poison will remain, while the antidote will be forgotten. The Doctor
observes:</p>

   <p class="blockquot"> "What could possibly induce you, with such ill-judged eagerness,
   to rake into the kennels of oblivion? Why do you exhibit among
   your authorities the publications of such a vile fellow as
   Rimius? Was you not informed that he wrote with all the rancour
   of a renegado, and all the spite of an enemy? Is such a man
   proper to be publicly called forth as a witness against a church
   which he had deserted from no excess of virtue; against a church
   which, yourself being judge, has, by its silent but honorable
   exertions, first glorified God among the heathen, and then
   stimulated the rest of the Christian world to engage in similar
   attempts; against a church which, according to your own
   representations, possesses in herself the rare principle of
   gradual melioration, and, by a constant course of good living,
   has, in the face of watchful enemies, been able to rise superior
   to the consequences of former acknowledged indiscretions in
   language? Did you know that those writings were sinking fast into
   deserved neglect? That the copies had become so rare, that it was
   scarcely possible to obtain one? What merit, I ask you, is there
   in such publications, that you should thus studiously fish them
   out of the mud which was already closing over them, and after
   carefully scraping off the filth and mould which they had
   contracted, spread over them a coating of your own poetical
   varnish?</p>

  <p class="blockquot">&mdash;&nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;&mdash;</p>

   <p class="blockquot">"What motive shall we assign for your conduct? You could not have
   intended to warn the Christian world against indulging in similar
   imprudences; for you well know that in the present day, society
   has not the smallest tendency that way. You could not mean to
   warn the Brethren against the recurrence of the same absurdities;
   for you acknowledge yourself that they have already for a long
   period risen superior to them; and instead of the least tendency
   to relapse, they have repeatedly and publicly confessed their
   mistake, and have suffered so much, and such often unmerited
   obloquy, on account of their long-exploded<a id="Page_250"></a> <span class="pagenum">[250]</span> phraseology,
   that they are more likely in future to keep too far within bounds
   from over caution, than once more wildly to overleap them.</p>

  <p class="blockquot">&mdash;&nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;&mdash;</p>

  <p class="blockquot"> "The only way to account for your conduct in this respect, is to
   suppose it owing entirely to inadvertence. You were merely
   amusing yourself, like the boys in the fable, unmindful that your
   sport might perhaps prove death to a set of poor frogs. But ought
   you not to have remembered the golden rule of Christ, never to do
   unto others what you would not choose to have done to yourself?
   Are you not still smarting under the blows you so lately received
   from the battle-axe of Wat Tyler? Believe me, sir, communities
   have feeling as well as individuals. In the days of your
   ignorance, as you will now call them, you wrote what you are at
   present ashamed of. To have composed Wat Tyler, you feel to be
   little congenial with the spirit that ought to dwell in a
   poet-laureate. When that unfortunate effusion of your pen was
   officiously dragged into light, did it not touch you to the
   quick? And why? Because you repented that you had ever written
   it. <i>We</i> repent of having written and said those things which
   occasioned Rimius' trumpet to sound. We have repeatedly declared
   that we do repent, and our conduct has proved the truth of our
   declaration. Must we not, therefore, feel pain at seeing our old
   delinquencies, long forgiven and forgotten, once more coupled
   with our name by a man of your respectable character and
   abilities? Is not the pain we feel the very impress of what you
   have felt, and still feel, on the score of Wat Tyler?"</p>

<h3>
<span>ARCHAIC AND PROVINCIAL WORDS.<br />
(Vol. v., p. 173.)</span>
</h3>


<p>In pursuance of my recommendation I now send to "N. &amp; Q." the following
provincial and technical words, as taken from the published evidence
given before the coroner at the inquest on the Holmefirth catastrophe.
Technical names have been there used, which are either strange or
unknown even to many engineers, and which no dictionary that I am
acquainted with contains. The inquiry is, however, one of such general
interest at this time, as connected with the recent fearful loss of
life, and enormous destruction of property, that I also give some words,
the meaning of which is not so obscure. The names of the reservoir which
was bursted, and of the village which suffered most damage, may be taken
first.</p>

<p><i>Bilberry Reservoir</i>: Bilberry is the local name of a berry growing on a
heath shrub; a species of <i>Vacci'nium</i>: the genus consists of about
fifty species. This berry, in England, is known as wimberry, blueberry,
blaeberry, blae, whortleberry, whort and huckleberry;
Saxon&mdash;<i>heort-berg</i>, hartberry; German&mdash;<i>heidel-beere</i>, heathberry;
Dutch&mdash;<i>blaauwbes</i>, blueberry. The reservoir, no doubt, covered a site
on which <i>Vacci'nium Myrtillus</i>, the common <i>bilberries</i>, grew.</p>

<p><i>Holmefirth</i>: this name may be from <i>holm</i>, the <i>Ilex</i>, the evergreen
oak; or <i>holm</i>, a tract of flat rich land on the bank of a brook or
river. <i>Frith</i>, a passage or narrow channel; or <i>frith</i>, a kind of
"<i>weir</i>" for catching fish.</p>

<p><i>Greenhowlers</i>: the name of a place where one of the witnesses resides.
<i>Howler</i>, or Owler, <i>Alnus glutinosa</i>, the common alder, a tree or shrub
growing in damp places, in plantations and hedges, mistaken by the
ignorant for the hazel. To send a boy "nutting amongst the <i>howlers</i>,"
is to put him upon a fool's task. This word is common in Lancashire and
Yorkshire.</p>

<p><i>Fall</i> is applied to a number of trees cut down.</p>

<p><i>Fresh</i>: a flood of water from heavy rain.</p>

<p><i>Drift</i>: a small tunnel made for mining or engineering purposes.</p>

<p><i>Drift</i>, in mechanics, a piece of steel or iron used to <i>back</i> a bolt,
or to widen a bolt-hole.</p>

<p><i>Dyke</i>: a small water-course or river.</p>

<p><i>Dyke</i>, in geology, a protruded wall of basalt or whin rock.</p>

<p><i>Goit</i>: a small artificial water-course leading to a mill or reservoir.</p>

<p><i>Runs</i>: small dykes.</p>

<p><i>Bye-wash</i>: an artificial water-course, to allow of the escape of flood
waters from a reservoir.</p>

<p><i>Rag</i>: a term for <i>shale</i>. In geology, thin-bedded, slaty strata.</p>

<p><i>Sludge</i> or <i>Sludgy</i>: mud or muddy.</p>

<p><i>Puddle</i>: prepared clay, tempered to form a wall in a reservoir bank, or
a lining to resist water.</p>

<p><i>Puddle-bank</i>, <i>Puddle-wall</i>, and <i>Puddle-dyke</i> mean the same.</p>

<p><i>Culvert</i>, <i>Sewer</i>, and <i>Sough</i> mean almost the same; an arched channel
of stone or brick for water or refuse to pass through. The first belongs
more properly to water-works; the two latter are synonyms applied to
town drainage, "<i>Sough</i>" being Lancashire.</p>

<p><i>Shuttle</i>, <i>Sluice</i>, <i>Valve</i>, <i>Clough</i>, <i>Paddle</i>: these five names are
synonyms; they mean that portion of the apparatus which <i>slides</i>, or is
drawn up and let down, to inclose or let out the water of an artificial
stream or reservoir.</p>

<p><i>Swallow</i>: the inner portion of the culvert, or <i>the throat</i> which leads
from the inner side of the reservoir to the "<i>shuttle</i>," the outer
portion being the supply-culvert.</p>

<p><i>Valve</i>: an apparatus to retain or let out water, steam, &amp;c. A valve may
slide as the <i>shuttle</i>, <i>paddle</i>, or <i>sluice</i> must do; or it may rise
with a spindle, vertically, as in the safety-valve of a steam boiler; or
may move on spindles or a hinge, as in some large pumps; or be in the
form of a ball, and play loose in a case, as in a fire-engine pump:
there are other forms of <i>valves</i>. <i>Throttle-valve</i>, a valve<a id="Page_251"></a> <span class="pagenum">[251]</span>
fixed in the steam-pipe of an engine, to which the <i>governor</i> is
attached, to <i>throttle</i> or reduce the supply of steam to the cylinder.
In some engines, as the locomotive, there is no governor motion, and the
<i>throttle-valve</i> is consequently used by hand.</p>

<p><i>Waste-pit</i>: a vertical pit or well, leading from the "<i>overflow</i>" on
the embankment into the supply; or, in this case, the "<i>waste culvert</i>."</p>

<p><i>Drawer</i>: the man employed to draw water from the reservoir by raising
the "<i>shuttle</i>."</p>

<p>Such is a brief explanation of some of the provincial and technical
words used in the Holmefirth inquiry; and I think some of the readers of
"N. &amp; Q." will have a right to say that a process of desynonymising is
required. So many names for the same thing, unless they are all
understood, generally lead to confusion.</p>


   <p class="right">    R<span class="smcap lowercase">OBERT</span> R<span class="smcap lowercase">AWLINSON.</span></p>


<p>In the neighbourhood of Canterbury we have the following.</p>

<p><i>Nail-bourn</i> is the name given to an intermittent land-spring, showing
itself at uncertain intervals. There is one in the parish of Petham,
another near Sir John Honywood's at Evington, and a third at Barham.</p>

<p><i>To chastise</i> is commonly used in the sense of <i>to tax</i>, or <i>to charge</i>,
a man; and is probably a mere corruption of <i>to catechise</i>.</p>

<p><i>Gazel</i> is the Kentish word for the black currant.</p>

<p>To get <i>lucker</i> means to get loose or flabby.</p>

<p>To <i>terrify</i> is used almost universally for to tease, to irritate.</p>

correct, as I have never seen the words written, and therefore only
spell them according to the sound.</p>

<p><i>Critch</i> (Hants): any earthenware vessel; a jar.</p>

<p><i>Dillijon</i>: a heavy two-wheeled cart. This word's similarity to the

<p>These verses I have dictated from memory after forty years, and there
may be some verbal inaccuracies. The name of "Tippoo" seems to point out
their Eastern origin, but I am not certain of the <i>exact title</i> of the
work from which I quote them, and I am indebted to "N. &amp; Q." for the
name of Mr. Sandys as the author of <i>Specimens of Macaronic Poems</i>. In
my copy there is no indication of the author. Was there a second
edition?</p>

<h3>
<span>YOUNG'S "NARCISSA."<br />
(Vol. iii., p. 422.)</span>
</h3>

<p>The inquiry by J. M. relative to the authority possessed by the letter
quoted from the <i>Evangelical Magazine</i> for Nov. 1797, may be fairly
answered by a reference to the letter in the magazine alluded to.</p>

<p>It is appended as a note to a "Memoir of the late Mr. Mouncher of
Southampton, written by the Rev. Mr. Kingsbury." The letter itself was
written from Montpellier in 1789, by Mr. Walter Taylor to his sister
Mrs. Mouncher; and, from the position of all those parties, would appear
to be deserving of credit as far as it goes.</p>

<p>It shows that Mr. W. Taylor, and others, conversed with the gardener of
the "King's Garden;" and from him (son of the former gardener) heard
that about forty-five years before Dr. Young had bribed the then
under-gardener to allow him to bury "Narcissa," and would thus prove
that the tradition existed at that time at Montpellier.</p>

<p>There is also in a retired part of the Botanic Garden (established by
Henry IV.) a stone bearing an inscription to "Narcissa," as mentioned in
Murray's <i>Hand-Book</i>, placed there probably in consequence of that
tradition. Moreover, it is believed, in the family of a gentleman of
Montpellier, that his maternal grandfather saw Dr. Young and his
step-daughter at Montpellier about the year 1741; that the lady died
there, and was buried, as is stated, in the garden; that however it was
not Mrs. Temple, but a younger sister of hers.</p>

<p>It appears from records in this country, that Lady Elizabeth Lee, by her
first marriage, had one son and two daughters. The son was buried at St.
Mary's-le-Strand in 1743; the elder daughter married Henry Temple, son
of Viscount Palmerston, and it appears died in France (perhaps at Lyons)
in 1736; the younger, Caroline, married Captain, afterwards General
Haviland, and died without issue. The General died at Penn in
Buckinghamshire in 1784; but no record relating to his first wife, Miss
Caroline Lee, is to be found there.</p>

<p>Such record, if found in any parish in England, would greatly tend to
decide the question. Possibly some correspondent may be in a position to
ascertain whether such record exists.</p>

<p>Lady Elizabeth had by her marriage with Dr. Young, a son only; it could
not, therefore, be a daughter of Young's who died at Montpellier.</p>

<h3>
<span>DULCARNON.<br />
(Vol. i., p. 254.; Vol. v., p. 180.)</span>
</h3>


<p>Why this word should have "set all editors of Chaucer at defiance" is
not very apparent, for he himself sufficiently explains its meaning by
the context. The passage in which it occurs is in <i>Troylus and
Creseyde</i>, b. iii. 931. seq. thus:</p>

<div class="poem">

  <div class="stanza">   <p> "Creseyde answerde, As wisely God at reste</p>
      <p>My soule bringe, as me is for him wo,</p>
  <p>    And eme, iwys, fayne wolde I dône the best,</p>
     <p> If that I a grace had for to do so.</p>
     <p> But whether that ye dwell, or for him go,</p>
     <p> I am, tyl God me bettre mynde sende,</p>
      <p>At <i>Dulcarnon, right at my wyttes end</i>.</p></div>

<div class="stanza">   <p>   "(Quod Pandarus). Ye nece! Wol ye here?</p>
    <p>  <i>Dulcarnon</i> is called flemyng of wretches.</p>
     <p> It semeth harde, for wretches wol nought lere</p>
 <p>     For very slouthe, or other wylful tetches:</p>
   <p>   This is said by hem, that be not worthe two fetches.</p>
     <p> But ye ben wyse," &amp;c.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p>Now Speght, in his Glossary to the edition of 1602, says:</p>

 <p class="blockquot"> "Dulcarnon is a proposition in Euclide, lib. i. theorem 33.
   propos. 47., which was found out by Pythagoras after an whole
   yeeres study, and much beating of his brayne. In thankfulnes
   whereof he sacrificed an oxe to the gods; which sacrifice he
   called <i>Dulcarnon</i>. Alexander Neckham, an ancient writer, in his
   booke <i>De Naturis rerum</i>, compoundeth this word of <i>Dulia</i> and
   <i>Caro</i>, and will have Dulcarnon to be <i>quasi sacrificium carnis</i>.
   Chaucer aptly applieth it to Creseide in this place: showing that
   she was as much amazed how to answer Troilus, as Pythagoras was
   wearied to bring his desire to effect."</p>

<p>Master Speght is somewhat in error in his solution: let us hear another
expositor. I have mentioned in your pages the existence of a translation
into rhymed Latin verse of the whole of Chaucer's <i>Troilus</i>, with a
copious commentary by Sir Francis Kynaston; and I may now add, for Mr.
Lang's satisfaction, that it is <i>penes me</i>. The following note there
occurs on this word:</p>

  <p class="blockquot">"<i>Dulcarnon</i>, &amp;c. By this exposition, which Pandarus makes of the
   word <i>Dulcarnon</i>, it is plaine that Chaucer sets it downe here as
   a worde in use in his time, and such a one as the logicians do
   call (being a word of no significant sense) <i>vox significans ad
   placitum</i>, as in English <i>twittle twattle</i>, <i>fiddle faddle</i>,
   quibling and conundrums, and the like. So <i>Dulcarnon</i> in those
   times was a word of the same signification as we at this day do
   use <i>nonplus</i>; as we say by a scholler that is apposed and cannot
   answer any further, that he is <i>put to a nonplus</i>, a phrase
   derived from Hercules' motto written upon the two great Gaditane
   pillars set on either side the Straights of Gibraltar: which
   Hercules constituted as the end of the world with these words,
   <span class="smcap lowercase">NON PLUS ULTRA</span>: meaning that no man ever did or could go further
   than those pillars. For Neckham's far-fetch'd criticisme in
   deriving the etymologie of the word Dulcarnon from the Greeke
   word <i>Doulia</i>, and the Latine word <i>Carnium</i>, that is, the
   service of flesh, which Euclide sacrificed for joy of the
   invention of a probleme which he demonstrated, [and] on which he
   had long studied, [it] is in my minde quite from the
   purpose."<a id="Page_253"></a> <span class="pagenum">[253]</span></p>

<p>The usual explanation, with a reference to Chaucer, will be found in
Blount's <i>Glossographia</i>, and in Philips's <i>World of Words</i>, as well as
in the folio edition of Bailey's <i>Dictionary</i>, where it is well defined
"<i>to be nonplussed, to be at one's wit's end</i>."</p>

<p>Mr. Inglis's note to his translation of Richard de Bury's
<i>Philobiblion</i>, which is taken from Billingsley, points out the
connexion between the words <i>Ellefuga</i> and <i>Dulcarnon</i>, which, as he
says, "have been a <i>pons asinorum</i> to some good Grecians." The reason
will appear to have been that the words were derived from the <i>Arabic</i>,
and not from the <i>Greek</i>, according to Dr. Adam Littleton:</p>

 <p class="blockquot">"<i>Dulcarnon</i>, i.e. bicorne, cornutum, à figura sic dicta. A hard
   proposition in Euclid, l. 1. prop. 47. So called in <i>Arabic</i>, and
   used by old English writers for <i>any hard question or point</i>.
   <span class="smcap lowercase">DILEMMA, PROBLEMA</span>."</p>

<p>So that to be at Dulcarnon may be said to be <i>on the horns of a
dilemma</i>.</p>

 <p class="right">     S. W. S<span class="smcap lowercase">INGER</span>.</p>


<p>I cannot see the great difficulty which Mr. Halliwell and your
correspondents perceive in the use of this word. Of course they are
aware, that Iscander Dulcarnein (Alexander Bicornis) is Alexander the
Great, the same name being also fabulously ascribed to a far more
ancient and imaginary king; and that the æra of Dulcarnein (or
Macedonian æra) is well known in Eastern chronology. There is therefore
no doubt about the word, only about its application. Why did the name of
this king stand for our Coventry or Jericho, a place to which the people
are flemed or banished?</p>

<p>Because Dulcarnein built the famous iron walls of Jajuge and Majuge,
within which Gog and Magog are confined until the latter days of the
world; when God shall reduce the wall to dust, and set free the captive
nations (<i>Koran</i>, cap. xviii.). Sending to Dulcarnein is merely an
ellipsis of the person for his place, <i>i.e.</i> for the rampart of
Dulcarnein. Certainly no men can be more effectually flemed than Gog and
Magog were.</p>

<p>But as to the point of being "at one's wits end," no one can be so
little conversant with human affairs as the inmates of the iron wall.
Knowledge depends much on place. So sailors say, "he has been <i>before</i>."</p>

<p>I have only an uncommented text of Chaucer. But I cannot understand his
editors allowing this word to "set them at defiance."</p>

<h3>
<span>ST. GEORGE HERALDICAL MSS.<br />
(Vol. v., pp. 59. 135.)</span>
</h3>


<p>It seems to be of so much importance to ascertain the safety of these
manuscripts, that M&mdash;<span class="smcap lowercase">N</span>. trusts he need not apologise for stating in "N.
&amp; Q." the result thus far of his inquiry after their present ownership.
In consequence of the recommendation of E. A. G. (Vol. v., p. 135.), Sir
Edward Tierney has been applied to, but he unfortunately knows nothing
of their fate, suggesting, however, a reference to Mr. Woodgate, who was
concerned as solicitor at the time of the sale. Mr. Woodgate has been
written to, and states that the manuscripts were sold with the other
effects of Lord Egmont, but he knows not to whom; he mentions Mr.
Braithwaite as the auctioneer. To apply to Mr. Braithwaite would be only
carrying the inquiry round in a circle, for twenty years ago, as was
stated at page 59, no satisfactory information could be gained there.
All, therefore, that remains is to place on record in this useful
journal the fact of the disappearance of these manuscripts, in the hopes
that some one of its numerous readers may be able now or hereafter to
give some account of their existence. When it is recollected that the
only copies of many of the latest visitations were among these
collections, and that the latter portion of the seventeenth century, to
which these visitations refer, is exactly that period in which
genealogists, from many causes, find the connexion of pedigrees the most
difficult, the discovery of their fate is not without its interest.</p>

  <p class="right">   M&mdash;<span class="smcap lowercase">N.</span></p>


<p>Noble's account of the sale of these MSS., after the death of Garter in
1715, is as follows:</p>

 <p class="blockquot">"Mr. Bridges of Herefordshire, his executor, obtaining possession
   of the heraldic books which Garter had in his house, never
   returned them to the College; they were very numerous and
   valuable, being some of the original visitations, taken by or
   under the authority of the St. Georges. With these also were many
   of Camden's books. These original documents were scandalously
   sold by Messrs. Wynne and Gregory [sons-in-law of Sir Henry St.
   George] to Thomas Percival, Earl of Egmont, a great lover of
   genealogical studies, who gave for them 500<i>l.</i>: they are now
   possessed by that nobleman's grandson, John-James, the present
   Earl of Egmont."&mdash;<i>Hist. Coll. Arms</i>, p. 353. 4to. 1804.</p>

<p>This statement has led to the inference, that the <i>whole</i> of St.
George's MSS. were disposed of to Lord Egmont; but the fact is
otherwise, for by far the most valuable portion of them was subsequently
in the hands of Thomas Osborne, the well-known bookseller of Gray's Inn;
who printed a list of them, with an index of the pedigrees, in his
catalogue entitled:</p>

 <p class="blockquot"> "A Catalogue of several valuable Libraries of Books and MSS. &amp;c.
   To which is prefixed a Genealogical Library in above Two hundred
   Manuscript Volumes in folio, &amp;c. Collected and augmented by the
   late Sir Henry St. George, Knt., Garter King of Arms, and his
   ancestors, in the office of Arms, for above these hundred years
   past. To begin to be sold, 27 November, 1738."<a id="Page_254"></a> <span class="pagenum">[254]</span></p>

<p>These MSS. are 216 in number, and many of them are at present in the
British Museum, in the Lansdowne Collection of MSS. Osborne reprinted
this list in his next catalogue for February 1738/9, entitled:</p>

 <p class="blockquot">"An Extensive and Curious Catalogue of valuable Books and MSS. in
   all Languages, &amp;c., including a very large Collection of Curious
   Genealogical Tracts," &amp;c.</p>

<p>After the MSS., which occupy pp. 68-92., is an "Appendix," consisting of
thirty-three pedigree rolls, chiefly on vellum, which also belonged to
St. George.</p>

<p>To conclude with a <i>Query</i>, may I ask, if any complete list of Osborne's
Catalogues can be obtained <i>previous</i> to 1756, when the list in
Nichols's <i>Literary Anecdotes</i>, vol. iii., begins?</p>

<h3>
<span>STERNE IN PARIS.<br />
(Vol. v., p. 105.)</span>
</h3>

<p>I inclose a copy of an autograph letter of Sterne's written when at
Paris. It is very interesting, and is not contained among his published
letters. Some few words are illegible, and several of the proper names
may be inaccurately copied.</p>

 <p class="blockquot"> "Paris, March 15, 1762.</p>

 <p class="blockquot">"My Dear,&mdash;Having an opportunity of writing by a physician, who is
posting off for London to-day, I would not omit doing it, though you
will possibly receive a letter (which is gone from hence last post) at
the very same time. I send to Mr. Foley's every mail-day, to inquire for
a letter from you; and if I do not get one in a post or two, I shall be
greatly surprised and disappointed. A terrible fire happened here last
night, the whole fair of St. Germain's burned to the ground in a few
hours; and hundreds of unhappy people are now going crying along the
streets, ruined totally by it. This fair of St. Germain's is built upon
a spot of ground covered and tiled, as large as the Minster Yard,
entirely of wood, divided into shops, and formed into little streets,
like a town in miniature. All the artizans in the kingdom come with
their wares&mdash;jewellers, silversmiths,&mdash;and have free leave from all
parts of the world to profit by general licence from the Carnival to
Easter. They compute the loss at six millions of livres, which these
poor creatures have sustained, not one of which have saved a single
shilling, and many fled out in their shirts, and have not only lost
their goods and merchandize, but all the money they have been taking
these six weeks. <i>Oh! ces moments de malheur sont terribles</i>, said my
barber to me, as he was shaving me this morning; and the good-natured
fellow uttered it with so moving an accent, that I could have found in
my heart to have cried over the perishable and uncertain tenure of every
good in this life.</p>

 <p class="blockquot">"I have been three mornings together to hear a celebrated pulpit orator
near me, one Père Clement, who delights me much; the parish pays him 600
livres for a dozen sermons this Lent; he is K. Stanislas's
preacher&mdash;most excellent indeed! his matter solid, and to the purpose;
his manner, more than theatrical, and greater, both in his action and
delivery, than Madame Clairon, who, you must know, is the Garrick of the
stage here; he has infinite variety, and keeps up the attention by it
wonderfully; his pulpit, oblong, with three seats in it, into which he
occasionally casts himself; goes on, then rises, by a gradation of four
steps, each of which he profits by, as his discourse inclines him: in
short, 'tis a stage, and the variety of his tones would make you imagine
there were no less than five or six actors on it together.</p>

 <p class="blockquot">"I was last night at Baron de Bagg's concert; it was very fine, both
music and company; and to-night I go to the Prince of Conti's. There is
a Monsieur Popignière, who lives here like sovereign prince; keeps a
company of musicians always in his house, and a full set of players; and
gives concerts and plays alternately to the grandees of this metropolis;
he is the richest of all the farmer...; he did me the honour last night
to send me an invitation to his house, while I stayed here&mdash;that is, to
his music and table.</p>

 <p class="blockquot">"I suppose you had terrible snows in Yorkshire, from the accounts I read
in the London papers. There has been no snow here, but the weather has
been sharp; and was I to be all the day in my room, I could not keep
myself warm for a shilling a day. This is an expensive article to great
houses here&mdash;'tis most pleasant and most healthy firing; I shall never
bear coals I fear again; and if I can get wood at Coswold, I will always
have a little. I hope Lydia is better, and not worse, and that I shall
hear the same account of you. I hope my Lydia goes on with her French; I
speak it fast and fluent, but incorrect both in accent and phrase; but
the French tell me I speak it most surprisingly well for the time. In
six weeks I shall get over all difficulties, having got over one of the
worst, which is to understand whatever is said by others, which I own I
found much trouble in at first.</p>

 <p class="blockquot">"My love to my Lyd&mdash;&mdash;. I have got a colour into my face now, though I
came with no more than there is in a dishclout.</p>

   <p class="blockquot">"I am your affectionate</p>

<h4>
<span><i>Etymology of Church</i> </span>
<span>(Vol. v., p. 79.).</span>
</h4>

<p>&mdash;Gieseler, in his <i>Lehrbuch der
Kirchengeschichte</i>, vol. i., p. 1. ed. 4., says that the word <i>kirche</i>
(and consequently <i>church</i>) is most probably derived from <span title="[Greek: to kyriakon]">&#964;&#8056;
 &#954;&#965;&#961;&#953;&#945;&#954;&#8057;&#957;</span>. In support of this opinion, he quotes Walafrid Strabo, who
wrote about <span class="smcap lowercase">A.D</span>. 840:</p>

  <p class="blockquot">"Si autem quæritur qua occasione ad vos vestigia hæc Græcitatis
   advenerint, dicendum&mdash;præcipue a Gothis, cum eo tempore quo ad
   fidem Christianam, licet non recto itinere [<i>i.e.</i> by means of
   Arianism], perducti sunt, in Græcorum provinciis commorantes,
   nostrum, <i>i.e.</i> theotiscum, sermonem habuerint."</p>

<p>He adds that Ulphilas is evidence for the general adoption of Greek
ecclesiastical terms by the Goths; and he confirms the idea of a Greek
derivation by the remark that derivatives of <span title="[Greek: kyriakon]">&#954;&#965;&#961;&#953;&#945;&#954;&#8057;&#957;</span> occur,
not only in the Teutonic languages, but in those of the Sclavonic
nations, whose conversion<a id="Page_256"></a> <span class="pagenum">[256]</span> proceeded from Greece. Thus, the
Bohemian word is <i>cyrkew</i>, the Russian <i>zerkow</i>, the Polish <i>cerkiew</i>.
The use of derivatives of <i>ecclesia</i> (which I would remind
M<span class="smcap lowercase">R</span>. S<span class="smcap lowercase">TEPHENS</span>
is also originally Greek) in the Roman languages, no doubt arises from
the circumstance that that word had been adopted into Latin, whereas the
other had not.</p>

<span><i>The Königsmarks</i></span>
<span> (Vol. v., pp. 78. 115. 183.).</span>
</h4>


<p>&mdash;It is certain from the
<i>State Trials</i>, ix. 31., that Count Charles John Königsmark, the
murderer of Mr. Thynn, was the elder of the two brothers; for it
appeared on the trial that the younger, Philip Christopher (a dozen
years later the gallant of the young Princess of Hanover), was at that
time a youth still under the care of a travelling tutor, who was
examined on the trial. This is stated in the <i>Quarterly Review</i>, art.
"Lexington Papers," to which inquirers had been already referred (Vol.
v., p. 115.). I am a little at a loss to account for J. R. J.'s
distribution of his epithets; he calls the case of the elder brother
"<i>mysterious</i>," and that of the second "<i>well-known</i>," when in truth the
former case is, and has been <i>well-known</i> these hundred and fifty years.
Whereas the second case was so long a mystery that it was nowhere told
but in a corner of Horace Walpole's <i>Reminiscences</i>, and he was mistaken
as to the identity of the victim,&mdash;a mistake but recently cleared up. I
believe, too, that until the discovery of the Lexington Papers, no one
altogether believed the story; and the minuter details of the case, such
as by whose order, and how, and when and where the deed was done, and
how and where the body was disposed of, are still so far mysterious that
Walpole's <i>Reminiscences</i> and the Princess's own notes differ
essentially on all those points.</p>

<span><i>L'Homme de 1400 Ans</i></span>
<span> (Vol. v., p 175.).</span>
</h4>

<p>&mdash;I have not immediate means of
access to the French work referred to in No. 121. of "N. &amp; Q.," and
therefore do not know how far the personage there alluded to is
described as "imaginary;" but it appears to me that Cagliostro may have
intended reference to his great friend and predecessor in Rosicrucian
philosophy, the Count de St. Germain. This arch-impostor, who attained
no small celebrity at the court of Louis XV., pretended to be possessed
of the elixir of life, by means of which he had prolonged his existence
from a period which he varied according to the supposed credulity of his
audience; at one time carrying back the date of his birth to the
commencement of the Christian Era, at others being content to assume an
antiquity of a few centuries, being assisted in his imposture by a most
accurate memory of the history of the times, the events of which he
related, and also by an able accomplice who attended him as a servant.
On one occasion, when describing at a dinner table a circumstance which
had occurred at the court of "his friend Richard I. of England," he
appealed to his attendant valet for the confirmation of his story, who,
with the greatest coolness replied: "You forget, Sir, I have only been
500 years in your service." "True," said his master, "it <i>was</i> a little
before your time." The origin of this able charlatan, of whom many other
amusing stories are related, is not known. He was sometimes thought,
from the Jewish cast of his features, to be the "wandering Jew;" while
others reported that he was the son of an Arabian princess, and that his
father was a Salamander.</p>

<p>&mdash;Paul Hentzner,
who was presented to Queen Elizabeth at the palace of Greenwich,
describes her majesty, who was then in her sixty-fifth year, as "very
majestic; her face oblong, <i>fair</i>, but wrinkled; her eyes small, yet
black and pleasant. She wore false hair, and that red." Delaroche,
however, in his well-known picture at the Luxembourg, has given her a
very swarthy complexion.</p>

<h4>
<span><i>Meaning of Knarres</i> </span>
<span>(Vol. v., p. 200.).</span>
</h4>

<p>&mdash;A <i>knare</i> is a <i>knot</i> or lump,
"<i>knarry</i>, <i>stubby</i>, <i>knotty</i>" (Coles's <i>Dictionary</i>, 1717). It was, no
doubt, as J. B<span class="smcap lowercase">R</span>. says, sometimes written <i>gnare</i>; and in that form is
the root of Shakspeare's "<i>gnarled</i> (or knotty) oak." In Norfolk and
Suffolk, small plantations&mdash;<i>not</i> "scrubby woods"&mdash;are called <i>carrs</i>,
as J. B<span class="smcap lowercase">R</span>. states, but certainly not from <i>knare</i>, but, as I rather
think, from their square shape, <i>carré</i>. Those that I am acquainted with
in those counties are generally of that form, and look like plantations
made on purpose for game. When you hear a <i>carr</i> mentioned in those
counties, you always think of a pheasants' preserve. I know not whether
the<a id="Page_257"></a> <span class="pagenum">[257]</span> same word and meaning extend inland. Nor do I think that
<i>knare</i> has any affinity with <i>snare</i>.</p>

  <p class="right">   C.</p>


<p>In reply to your correspondent's Query, I beg to submit the following,
which may prove of utility in tracing out the meaning of the word,
viz.:&mdash;<i>Forby's Glossary</i> by Turner, vol. i. p. 56., thus has it:</p>

 <p class="blockquot"> "C<span class="smcap lowercase">AR</span>, <i>s.</i> a
wood or grove on a moist soil, generally of alders."</p>

<p class="noindent">We have them in this country; also the term "osier-cars."</p>

<p>In Kersey's <i>English Dictionary</i>, 1708, we have thus:</p>

 <p class="blockquot">"GNAR or G<span class="smcap lowercase">NUR</span>, a hard knot in wood."</p>

<p>In Bailey's <i>Dictionary</i>, 1753, we have it thus:</p>

 <p class="blockquot"> "G<span class="smcap lowercase">NARR</span>
[Knorre, Teutonic], a hard knot in a tree.&mdash;<i>Chaucer.</i>"</p>

<p class="noindent">May it not thus mean a knot or clump of trees?</p>

<p>It is also allied to <i>quarry</i>, from the French <i>carré</i>, which signifies
a bed, not only for digging stones for building purposes, but also as
they are sometimes called, <i>osier-beds</i>, <i>alder-beds</i>.</p>

<p>The towns "Narborough" and "Narford" in Norfolk are so called from their
being situated on the river "Nar;" the one a city or town on the river;
and the other being, by means of a ford, originally over it. Both were
originally written <i>Nere</i> as the prefix.</p>

<h4>
<span><i>Sir Alexander Cumming and the Cherokees.</i></span>
</h4>

<p>&mdash;There is a Query by S. S.
(Vol. iii., p. 39.) about Sir Alexander Cumming and the Cherokees, which
I do not think has yet had any reply. Vol. iii., p. 152., a replyist
refers to a work in which is an autobiography of the baronet. I have not
had an opportunity to refer to <i>that</i>, but I suspect it would not meet
the question, as Sir Alexander Cumming of Coulter, who was created a
Nova Scotia baronet 1695, and Alexander Cumming, the King of the
Cherokees, were diverse persons. The last died in 1775, and according to
Lysons was buried at East Barnet. At vol. iv. p. 20., under Barnet,
Lysons gives the following account bearing on the Cherokees:</p>

  <p class="blockquot">"In 1729 he (Cumming) was induced, by a dream of Lady Cumming's,
   to undertake a voyage to America, for the purpose of visiting the
   Cherokee nations. He left England on the 13th of September, and
   arrived at Charlestown on the 5th of December. On the 11th of
   March following he set out for the Indians' country; on the 3rd
   of April, 1730, he was crowned commander and chief ruler of the
   Cherokee nations, in a general meeting of chiefs at Nequisee
   among the mountains; he returned to Charlestown the 13th of April
   with six Indian chiefs, and on the 5th of June arrived at Dover;
   on the 18th he presented the chiefs to George II. at Windsor,
   where he laid his crown at his Majesty's feet; the chiefs also
   did homage, laying four scalps at the king's feet, to show that
   they were an overmatch for their enemies, and five eagles' tails
   as emblems of victory. These circumstances are confirmed by the
   newspapers of that time, which are full of the proceedings of the
   Cherokees whilst in England, and speak of them as brought over by
   Sir Alexander Cumming. Their portraits were engraved on a single
   sheet. In 1766 Archbishop Secker appointed him one of the
   pensioners in the Charter-House, where he died at a very advanced
   age."</p>

<p>His son, who succeeded him in the title, became deranged in his
intellects, and died about three years ago, in a state of indigence, in
the neighbourhood of Red Lion Street, Whitechapel. He had been a captain
in the army: the title became extinct at his death.</p>

<span><i>Junius</i></span>
<span> (Vol. iii., p. 411.; Vol. v., p. 159.).</span>
</h4>

<p>&mdash;As in No. 120. J. R.
assumes the acrimonious bearing of M. J. in No. 82., I am induced to
refer to the stale, flat, and unprofitable question of the authenticity
of the Letters of Junius. If those gentlemen will refer to No. 82., p.
412., fifth line from the bottom, and read "<i>who once</i>" for "<i>and
once</i>," they will find any acrimony unnecessary; and that the use of the
word "<i>and</i>" was an accidental error. This useless riddle has occupied
too much of the time of able and of idle men, on what is, moreover, a
worthless subject. Dr. Johnson, in his paper on the "Falkland Islands,"
has given a severe but just criticism on Junius, and truly says, that
most readers mistake the "venom of the shaft for the vigour of the bow."
Junius has laid down no great principle, illustrated no political truth,
nor given any clear and irrefutable proof of contemporaneous history. To
attribute reprehensible motives always shows lowness and vulgarity of
mind. Junius gives one the idea of a democratic ruff mounted on stilts
going, from natural predilection, through the mud and dirt, and
splashing it wantonly, so as to bespatter and annoy a few, and to excite
the attention and surprise of many; but never to produce a conviction of
being just and true on any one.&mdash;<i>Requiescat in pace.</i></p>

<p>&mdash;The explanation given by J. S<span class="smcap lowercase">ANSOM</span> of
the Devonian use of the term <i>helling</i> or <i>heleing</i>, signifying the roof
or covering of a church, corresponds to the Midland meaning of the word
<i>hilling</i>, <i>s.</i> bed-clothes or coverlet: "She has got no <i>hilling</i> at
all." Ger. <i>Hüllen</i>, to wrap one's self up; Saxon, <i>hilan</i>. In
Warwickshire used for the covers of a book: "It is the <i>hilling</i> which
makes it so expensive." <i>Hilled</i>, p. <i>hilled up</i>, <i>i.e.</i> covered with
bed-clothes. Leicestershire is particularly rich in quaint phrases and
proverbs.</p>

<p>In Leicestershire it is common for the wives of farmers to style their
husbands "the Master," and husbands to call their wives "Mamy;" and a
labourer will often distinguish his wife by the title of "the O'man."
There are people now living who remember the time when <i>Goody</i> and

   except one tribe, who were known by the name of Yankoos, which
   signifies invincible. After the waste of much blood and treasure,
   the Yankoos were at last subdued by the New Englandmen. The
   remains of this nation (agreeable to the Indian custom)
   transferred their name to their conquerors. For a while they were
   called Yankoos; but from a corruption, common to names in all

<p>&mdash;The

a mango," is referred to Blomfield's <i>History of Norfork</i>, vol. v. p.
155. (8vo edition), where he will find a curious song, called the
"Ballad of Ashwell Thorp," (said to be made in Sir Thomas Knevet's time,
who was Sheriff of Norfolk in 1579, and died about 1616), showing that a
similar trick was known in England at that time. An account is here
given of an acorn being sown in the middle of a hall, growing up in a
few minutes to a prodigious tree, bearing acorns, which ripened and
fell; and how, after the tree had been with much difficulty cut down by
two woodcutters, the trunk and fragments were finally carried away by
two goslings. The feat is said to have been performed by a Londoner. The
ballad-monger has perhaps improved a little upon the simple facts of the
case. He concludes by saying:</p>

<p>&mdash;In quoting the note to Lord
Lindsay's <i>Christian Art</i>, extracted from MS. <i>Collectanea</i> of Sir David
Lindsay of the Mount, and illustrating a story of the Pelican, your
correspondent F. W. I. wishes for a translation of the word <i>crabis</i>,
which Sir David makes use of in describing the undutiful behaviour of
the young pelicans towards their paternal parent.</p>

<p>The old Scotch verb, <i>crab</i>, signified to tease, vex, annoy. As an
active verb it is now obsolete, but it is still in use, at least its
participles are in a passive sense. I have frequently heard <i>crabbing</i>
used to describe the state of mind of one out of humour or sulking.
<i>Crabbed</i> has long been an English word, and as such has its place in
Johnson's <i>Dictionary</i>. It is not in such common use to the south as it
is to the north of the Tweed; but from the Land's End to
John-o'-Groat's, it is used to designate a chronic form of the same
failing, which, in its temporary form, is described above as "crabbing."
It is, moreover, applied to man's works as well as to his temper. A
<i>crabbed hand</i> and a <i>crabbed style</i> of writing are expressions of
every-day use in Scotland, and are eminently descriptive of the effect
of such writing upon the temper of the reader.</p>

<h4>
<span><i>John of Padua</i> </span>
<span>(Vol. v., pp. 79. 161.).</span>

<p>&mdash;I am afraid we are not likely
to obtain much additional information about John of Padua. The only
account of him which I have ever met with is contained in the Earl of
Orford's <i>Works</i> (vol. iii. p. 100. et seqq., edit. 1798). The warrant,
dated 1544, is there copied from Rymer's <i>F&oelig;dera</i>?; and from an
expression which it contains, the inference is drawn that "John of Padua
was not only an architect, but musician." I am not aware whether or no
there is any other authority for such inference, but, if there is not, I
submit that the evidence is far from conclusive. The words in the
warrant run thus: A fee of two shillings per diem is granted to John,
"in consideratione boni et fidelis servitii quod dilectus serviens
noster Johannes de Padua nobis in architecture, ac <i>aliis in re musica
inventis</i> impendit ac impendere intendit."</p>

<p>Now, Sir, I submit that <i>res musica</i>, in this passage, is used in the
same sense as the Greek <span title="[Greek: hê mousikê]">&#7969; &#956;&#959;&#965;&#963;&#953;&#954;&#8052;</span> for "the fine arts;" and
that the passage can have no reference to the art of the musician.</p>

<p>If John of Padua had been a musician, we should most probably meet with
his name in some of the accounts of plays and pageants during this
reign; and the silence of your correspondents seems to imply that no
information concerning him is to be obtained from those sources.</p>

<p>In the absence of further proof, then, I have no hesitation in proposing
to the critical readers of "N. &amp; Q.," a resolution that, It is the
opinion of this council that there is no sufficient evidence that John
of Padua was a musician.</p>

was held by me, whereas I have stated (Vol. v., p. 14.), even more
explicitly than he, that&mdash;</p>

 <p class="blockquot"> "The barbarism in question is to be charged less upon the modern
   Greeks themselves, than upon the European nations, Sclavonians,
   Normans, and Venetians, and, later still, the Turks; who seized
   upon their country on the dismemberment of the Roman empire. The
   Greeks themselves, no doubt, continued to spell their proper
   names correctly; but their invaders, ignorant of their
   orthography, and even of their letters, were forced to write the
   names of places in characters of their own, guided solely by the
   sound."</p>

<h4>
<span><i>Beocherie, alias Parva Hibernia</i> </span>
<span>(Vol. v., p. 201.).</span>
</h4>

<p>&mdash;<i>Beocera-ig</i>,
i.e. the bee-keeper's island, was one of the small islets adjacent to
the larger one, Avallon, whereon the Abbey of Glastonbury stood.
Glastonbury was early resorted to by Irish devotees; St. Patrick and St.
Bridget necessarily resided there. Concerning <i>Beocherie</i> or <i>Bekery</i>,
we are told that there "olim sancta Brigida perhendinavit" (MS. Ashmol.
790, quoted in the <i>Monasticon</i>, vol. i. p. 22.). This accounts for the
name Parva Hibernia. <i>Beocera-gent</i>, in charter 652, is the name of some
landmark or boundary. There can be little doubt that we should read
<i>beocera-geat</i>, i.e. bee-keeper's gate, as suggested by Mr. Kemble in
the preface to the third vol. of <i>Codex Dipl.</i> p. xxvi. The duties and
rights of the <i>beocere</i>, <i>beo-ceorl</i>, or <i>bocherus</i>, are described in
the "Rectitudines singularum personarum," Thorpe's <i>Anc. Laws</i>, vol. i.
p. 434.</p>

<span><i>Ruffles, when worn</i> </span>
<span>(Vol. v., pp. 12. 139.).</span>

<p>&mdash;Planché, in his <i>History
of British Costume</i>, says that during the reign of Henry VIII., "the
sleeves were <i>ruffed</i>, or <i>ruffled</i> at the hand, as we perceive in the
portrait of Henry. <i>They were not added to the shirt till the next
century.</i>"</p>

<span><i>Long Meg of Westminster</i></span>
<span> (Vol. ii., pp. 131. 172.; Vol. v., p. 133.).</span>
</h4>

<p>&mdash;As an instance of this title being applied (as Fuller has it)
"to persons very<a id="Page_260"></a> <span class="pagenum">[260]</span> tall," I subjoin the following notice of a
death, which appeared in a newspaper of September, 1769:</p>

 <p class="blockquot"> "At London, Peter Branan, aged 104. He was six feet six inches
   high, and was commonly called <i>Long Meg of Westminster</i>. He had
   been a soldier from eighteen years of age."</p>

<p>This notice is extracted in the <i>Edinburgh Antiquarian Magazine</i>, but
without mentioning the quarter from which it was taken.</p>

<h4>
<span><i>Family Likenesses</i></span>
<span> (Vol. v., p. 7.).</span>
</h4>

<p>&mdash;To trace a family likeness for a
century is not at all uncommon. Any one who knows the face of the
present Duke of Manchester will see a strong likeness to his great
ancestor, through six generations, the Earl of Manchester of the
Commonwealth, as engraved in Lodge's <i>Portraits</i>. The following instance
is more remarkable. Elizabeth Hervey was Abbess of Elstow in 1501. From
her brother Thomas is descended, in a direct line, the present Marquis
of Bristol. If any one will lay the portrait of Lord Bristol, in Mr.
Gage Rokewode's <i>Thingoe Hundred</i>, by the side of the sepulchral brass
of the Abbess of Elstow, figured in Fisher's <i>Bedfordshire Antiquities</i>,
they cannot but be struck by the strong likeness between the two faces.</p>

<p>This is valuable evidence on the disputed point, whether portraits were
attempted in sepulchral brasses.</p>

<h4>
<span>"<i>A Roaring Meg</i>" </span>
<span>(Vol. v., p. 105.).</span>
</h4>

<p>&mdash;In Ghent, in Flanders, there is
still to be seen a wrought-iron gun, a sister of Mons Meg, the famous
piece of artillery in Edinburgh Castle. She is named Dulle Griete, Mad
Margery, or Margaret, and may possible be the elder sister after whom
the rest of the family have been named.</p>

<p>&mdash;Your several

to this very extraordinary individual, appear to have overlooked the
fact that a cabinet portrait by Rembrandt is to be seen in the

<span>(Vol. i., pp. 388. 474; Vol. ii., p. 13.)</span>

<p>&mdash;I find the two
following mentions of Pimlico as a public place of entertainment:</p>

<p>1. In <i>A Joviall Crew, or the Merry Beggars</i>, by R. Brome: first acted,
1641, at Drury Lane, edit. 1708:</p>

<div class="poem">

     <p> "To Pimblicoe we'll go,</p>

<h4>
<span>"<i>Wise above that which is written</i>" </span>
<span>(Vol. v., p. 228.).</span>
</h4>

<p>&mdash;This phrase is
evidently a quotation of 1 Cor. iv. 6., though not according to the
authorised translation, the words in the original being <span title="[Greek: mê hyper ho gegraptai phronein]">&#956;&#8052; &#8017;&#960;&#8050;&#961; &#8003;
 &#947;&#8051;&#947;&#961;&#945;&#960;&#964;&#945;&#953; &#966;&#961;&#959;&#957;&#949;&#8150;&#957;</span>. Here,
 however, the verb cannot mean "to be
wise," which is the meaning given to it in the phrase in question; for
the context requires it to be taken (as in our version) in the sense of
"elation of mind, to the despising of others."</p>

<p>The Query of R. C. C. reminds me of another phrase, which in a somewhat
similar way one hears continually quoted in sermons, &amp;c., as a text:
viz. "that he that runs may read." I should like to know whether this
strange perversion of Hab. ii. 2., which seems to be the source whence
it is derived, can be accounted for in any way.</p>

<h4>
<span><i>Sir John Cheke</i></span>
<span> (Vol. v., p. 200.).</span>
</h4>

<p>&mdash;C. B. T. will find an account of
Sir John Cheke in Harwood's <i>Alumni Etonenses</i>, under the head of
"Provosts of King's College." I send also from an old MS. the following
account; not being responsible for its accuracy, nor for the correctness
of the references:</p>

  <p class="blockquot"> "Sir John Cheke put into the Provostship by Edward VI., April 1,
   1548, though not qualified, as not of the Society, nor in orders.
   See his <i>Life</i> by Strype; Fuller, <i>Hist. Camb.</i>, 119.; Burnet,
   ii. 115., who says that in consequence of the controversy with
   Gardiner about the Gr. Pronuntiation he was either put from the
   chair, or willingly left it. This was not the case. He did not
   quit it till sent for by the King, as appears from the Life of
   his successor, Nic. Carr, p. 59.; see, too, Wood <i>Hist. and
   Antiq.</i>, lib. i. p. 26. His mother stood godmother to the child
   of a poor woman in Cambridge Gaol on suspicion of murder. (See
   Latimer's <i>First Serm.</i> p. 125., edit. 1635; Burnet, ii. 213.;
   Wood, <i>Hist. and Antiq.</i>, I. ii. 251.; Burnet, ii.<a id="Page_261"></a> <span class="pagenum">[261]</span> 51.,
   and <i>App.</i> 150.; Fuller, 29. 127.; and Fox, <i>Mart.</i>; Burnet, ii.
   155.; Burnet, ii. 8. 203.; <i>Benefices conferred on Laymen,
   Walker's Attempt</i>, ii. 68.; Wood, <i>Athen.</i>, i. 111.) Burnet and
   Fuller's account of his retiring on the King's death do not
   agree. For his works see Bale, and his Life, by Dr. Gerard
   Langbaine, before a work of Cheke's, <i>The True Subject to the
   Rebel, or the Hurt of Sedition</i>: Oxon, 1641, 4to. Haddon wrote
   his epitaph. See Ascham's <i>Letters</i>: Oxon, 1703, p. 436., about
   his recantation. See Leland's <i>Cygnea Cantio</i>, 1558, p. 21.; and
   Preface to Hickes's <i>Thesaurus</i>, 1. 2."</p>

<h4>
<span><i>Richard Earl of Chepstow</i> </span>
<span>(Vol. v., p. 204.).</span>
</h4>

<p>&mdash;H. C. K. will find in
the <i>Conquest of Ireland</i>, by Giraldus Cambrensis, my authority for
styling Richard Strongbow Earl of Chepstow: <i>e.g.</i> Dermod MacMurrough
addresses a letter to him as follows: "Dermon MacMorogh, prince of
Leinster, to Richard earle of Chepstoue, and son of Gilbert the Earle,
greeting," &amp;c. I quote from Hooker's translation, ed. 1587, p. 11.
Hooker, in a note, p. 4., says that Chepstow in times past was named
Strigulia, "whereof Richard Strangbow being earle, he took his name,
being called <i>Comes</i> Strigulensis."</p>

<p>H. C. K.'s <i>second</i> conjecture, as to the parentage given to Earl
Richard in the Ormonde charter, seems to be the correct one. I cannot
call to mind an instance of a second Christian name used at so early a
date.</p>

<p>The first coat given to the De Clares, in Berry's <i>Encycl.</i>, viz. <i>ar.
on a chief az. three crosses pattée fichée of the field</i>, occurs on the
shield of the effigy in Christ Church Cathedral, Dublin, popularly said
to be that of Richard Earl of Pembroke. Query, does Berry's statement
rest on the authority of that tradition? if so, it has a very sandy
foundation. I have very little doubt that the bearing visible on the
shield, as represented on the earl's seal attached to the charter in
possession of the Earl of Ormonde, is intended to represent <i>three
chevrons</i>.</p>

<p>H. C. K. has my best thanks for his communication. I shall be still more
obliged by an extract from the pedigree in his possession.</p>

<p>&mdash;If your correspondent, who

Spruner's <i>Atlas Antiquus</i>, published at Gotha in 1850, I think he will
find what he desires.</p>

<h4>
<span><i>Lady Diana Beauclerk.</i></span>
</h4>

<p>&mdash;I have to thank you for inserting my memorandum
respecting my miniature of Oliver Cromwell. I must further trespass on
your kindness to correct an error (and a very inexcusable one) in my
last statement, to which the kindness of a friend has called my
attention.</p>

<p>Lady Diana Beauclerk was not, as I stated, a daughter of the Duke of St.
Alban's, but of the Duke of Marlborough (Charles, second duke), and
married the Hon. Topham Beauclerk, who was the friend of Dr. Johnson,
and a well-known personage in his day.</p>

<p>The miniature therefore may have been "long" either in her own family,
or in that of her husband; but I presume she meant in her own. The
Churchills were as much connected with the "Stuarts" as afterwards with
their successors. I regret this inattention on my part.</p>

<p>&mdash;I was intimate some
time since with a gentleman who had been a student in Maynooth College,
and who frequently used to quote the words "Litera scripta manet," with
the addition, "Verbum imbelle perit." This may give a clue to the source
of the phrase, which may be found probably in some ecclesiastical or
theological work of days gone by.</p>

<p>&mdash;The first passage
respecting which W. D<span class="smcap lowercase">N</span>.
inquires ("Qui vult plenè," &amp;c.) will be found
in the first chapter of the first book of Thomas à Kempis, <i>De

<p>&mdash;In reply to S. S., the best
Catalogue of Engraved Portraits is one published by the late Mr. Edward
Evans, of Great Queen Street, Lincoln's Inn Fields, many years since;
and although the last number is 11,756, yet, as two and three portraits
are mentioned under the same figures, the total number noticed greatly
exceeds the above.</p>

<h3>
<span>NOTES ON BOOKS, ETC.</span>
</h3>

<p>So long as the people of this country are animated by that deep-rooted
love of true liberty and national independence, which have proved at so
many momentous periods of our history to be at once their ruling
principle and the country's safeguard, so long will the memory of
Gustavus Vasa, the patriotic king of Sweden, be to all Englishmen an
object of the deepest interest. The publication therefore of a <i>History
of Gustavus Vasa, with Extracts from his Correspondence</i>,&mdash;which,
although based upon the narrative of his startling adventures, his
gallant exploits, and the picture of his manly sincere character, and
his quaint but telling eloquence, given by Geijer in his <i>History of
Sweden</i>, has been carefully elaborated by references to original
authorities, and rendered more picturesque by the introduction of
copious extracts from his correspondence,&mdash;is good service rendered to
the cause of historic truth. The writer is obviously an earnest, able,
and painstaking man; and we think that his work will be received (as it
deserves) with such favour<a id="Page_262"></a> <span class="pagenum">[262]</span> as to induce him to furnish us with
other illustrations of the history of the North.</p>

<p>If ever mortal man was a hero to his valet de chambre, such was the
"Great Cardinal" to his gentleman usher Master George Cavendish; and to
this fact and the reverent spirit which pervades his narration, may the
great popularity of <i>Cavendish's Life of Wolsey</i> be in a great measure
ascribed. Few biographies have been perused with greater interest; few
have exercised the editorial skill of better scholars. Dr. Wordsworth,
Mr. Singer, and Mr. Hunter, have all displayed their learning and
ingenuity in its illustration; and we have been led into these remarks
by the receipt of a new and very handsomely printed edition, which has
just been published by Messrs. Rivington, and which has been edited by
Mr. Holmes of the British Museum. Mr. Holmes' name is a sufficient
guarantee for the manner in which that duty has been executed.</p>

<p>We learn from <i>The Athenæum</i> of Saturday last that the Royal Society of
Antiquaries of Copenhagen, whose works illustrative of the early history
both of Greenland and America are known to many of our readers, are
about to publish a new edition of the <i>Orkneyinga Saga</i>, and sundry old
Northern fragments relative to Great Britain and Ireland; and in the
prosecution of this important and useful object they are desirous of
having the assistance and co-operation of the scholars and antiquaries
of this country. Antiquaries find favour in the North, for <i>The Times</i>
reports that the general yearly meeting of this Society was held on the
25th of February at the Christiansborg Palace, Copenhagen, his Majesty
the King of Denmark in the chair. The secretary, Professor C. Rafn, read
the report of transactions for the last year, and gave a <i>précis</i> of the
articles in the forthcoming archæological works of the Society. The
printing and engravings of the second volume of the great work,
<i>Antiquités Russes et Orientales</i>, are now nearly completed. The learned
professor exhibited four Icelandic planispheres and maps of the world,
from the twelfth and thirteenth centuries, and made some observations on
the geographical and astronomical knowledge of the ancient
Scandinavians. The second volume of the Arna-Magnean Committee's edition
of <i>Snorro Sturleson's, or the Younger Edda</i>, was also nearly finished,
and preparations were being made for the publication of an <i>Icelandic
Diplomaticum</i>. His Majesty the King exhibited a remarkable collection of
antiquities of the bronze period discovered at Smorumorre, evidently
belonging to a workshop for the fabrication of such implements, and
clearly proving that bronze weapons, &amp;c. had been made in Denmark. On
the characteristics of this collection His Majesty was graciously
pleased to deliver some very interesting observations. Professor
Wegener, Vice-President, read an able memoir on the history of the old
castles of Soborg and Adserbo, in the north of Iceland. The
Archæological Committee exhibited a collection of articles discovered at
Anhalt (in the Cattegat) which belonged to a workshop for the
manufacture of stone implements, on which Mr. Thomsen made some useful
remarks. The museum was in a flourishing state. There had been 148
donations received and 761 presentations of antiquities. The proceedings
were closed by the election of Victor Emanuel, King of Sardinia, and his
Royal Highness Prince Albert of Saxe Coburg Gotha, as fellows of the
Society.</p>

on Both Sides of the Channel, being the Story of the Emperor Napoleon's
projected Invasion.</i> A brilliant, we might say eloquent, description of
the feeling which ran through the whole length and breadth of the land
when Napoleon's threats of invasion drew from the united nation, as with
the voice of one man, the declaration that "England never did, and never
shall lie at the proud foot of a conqueror!" In this picture of the past
we have a prophecy of the future, if the peace of Europe should be again
disturbed, and any attempt be made to renew the project of 1803. We do
not think this likely; but to secure Peace we must be prepared for War:
and he who, in the present aspect of affairs, would bid us disarm, must
be or fool, or traitor, or both.&mdash;<i>Memoirs of the late Thomas Holcroft,
written by himself, and continued to the time of his Death, from his

does it happen to various members of society that they wish to purchase

anxiously desired, and yet, how difficult it frequently is to procure

obviate this difficulty, a supply of the daily dates, of past and future
years, will be kept on sale at Mr. JAMES GILBERT's, 49. Paternoster Row,

<p class="center x-large">TOMB OF THE TRADESCANTS.</p>

<p>In Lambeth Churchyard is a Monument, once handsome and elaborately
carved, which was erected in 1662 by the widow of JOHN TRADESCANT the
younger, to the memory of her father-in-law, her husband, and her son,
who were inhabitants of that parish.</p>

<p>The Monument of the TRADESCANTS, which was repaired by public
subscription in 1773, has now again fallen into decay. The inscription
also on the stone that covers ASHMOLE's grave, who was himself buried in
Lambeth Church, is now very nearly effaced. The restoration of that
Church, now nearly finished, seems a fit occasion for repairing both
these Monuments. It is therefore proposed to raise a fund for the
perfect restoration of the Tomb of the TRADESCANTS, according to its
original form, as represented in two drawings preserved in the Pepysian
Library at Cambridge, and also for renewing ASHMOLE's epitaph. The cost
will not be less than 100<i>l.</i>, and assistance is earnestly requested
from all who are anxious to preserve ancient monuments, especially those
who are following the same pursuits as the TRADESCANTS, and who are
daily deriving benefit and delight from the labours and discoveries of
these first of English gardeners and naturalists.</p>
